                    Seed Equity Investments are used to form equity investment
                    partnerships which serve as the foundation for building a
                    strong startup community. <br />
                    <br /> During our formative years we've gained insightful
                    experience by working with dozens of innovative startups and
                    we now provide Seed Equity Investments for five new startup
                    teams each year. <br />
                    <br /> With a funding range between 5,000 to 25,000 USD per
                    team, our Seed Equity Investments are not loans, but equity
                    based investments. <br />
                    <br /> Local co-investor equity participation is encouraged
                    and generated through seminars and presentations within the
                    greater Phnom Penh business community.

                    We strive to be aware and knowledgeable of the natural world

                    impact that world.
